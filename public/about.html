                    <div class="para">The Souhegan Exhibition of Learning is a place where all 
                        students can show off their hard work. 
                        Right now we are only in stage one, where only art 
                        students have the opportunity to express their learning. 
                        But as the website gets updated it will live up to its dream.
                        A dream where you can listen to the band or the jazz band. 
                        A place where you can see the engineering builds or the math projects.
                        A place where you can see the pottery or the photography. 
                        Stay tuned as this dream is gradually fulfilled.
